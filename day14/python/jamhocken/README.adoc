== What I learned

. The most challenging was to think about how to parse the file easily.

== Approach

. I use regex to fish out all of the numbers in the lines of the input file. Then I go through them pair-wise and create a set of tuples with all of the occupied spots in the cave. Fortunately, it's not too big. :-)

**Star 1** +

. I just let the sand fall and check if it hits an occupied spot and follow the rules. After I find it's resting spot, i put it into my set containing all of the occupied spots. I do this until a sand falls below my deepest point.

**Star 2** +

. Yoohoo! No major changes necessary. I just add one to my deepest point and exit the loop when (500,0) is occupied. You have to get lucky sometimes.

== Run script
Run the solution with `python solution.py`
