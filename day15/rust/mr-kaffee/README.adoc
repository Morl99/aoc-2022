== Day 15: Beacon Exclusion Zone ==

https://rust-lang.org[Rust] solution to https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/15[AoC|2022|15].

This one was a challenge for me. Part one was initially solved with brute force. My current solution projects ranges on the row to scan.

For part 2, brute force was not a real option.

=== Star 2 ===

The idea is that the position of the distress beacon must be just outside the range of at least two sensors. Hence, for all pairs of sensors, I find the points that are just outside of both sensor's ranges as candidates. Out of these candidates, I search for a point that is also outside of all the other sensor's ranges. 

Well ... it works. But coming up with the formulas for the points was a pain and very error prone for me. I am sure there is something more elegant and simple.

There is also a flaw in the candidates function. Normally, it should be symmetric, i.e., `candidates(s1, s2) == candidates(s2, s1)`; it is not in all cases. I guess this is rounding issues ... It seems the function returns rather too many candidates than too few, which would not be an issue.

=== Star 2 -- Scan Lines === 

A solution using the functionality from star 1 is as follows. Much simpler code but much longer run-time.
